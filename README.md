# Fantasy League

## Project Overview

This application will allow users to create football teams and players into a fantasy league by  adding it to an already existing database. When the user selects a player, the player's attributes such as name, age, height, strongest foot and position will appear. These are all stored in the players table.

When a team is selected, the team description and the number of trophies won will be on show. This information is stored in the teams table in the database.

## Sprints

#### Sprint 1

##### Sprint Goals

The goals for this sprint was to complete the GitHub Project Board where all project backlog, sprint backlog and the definition of Done was completed. Then it was to create the database and insert data in the database.

##### Sprint Review

Creating the database was completed quite quickly whilst also doing most of the Project Board. However, not all the sprint goals could be achieved due to the lack of knowledge on how the different layers work and how to create a good functional GUI.

##### Sprint Retrospective

The major blocker of this sprint was the lack knowledge heading into the project. A university exam on Friday and revising for a C# data test on Tuesday put me back so I had to spend most of sprint 1 refreshing myself on the different CRUD operations and how to create a good, functional GUI. This was done by watching various videos on the likes of YouTube and the Microsoft Stream.

#### Sprint 2

##### Sprint Goals

The goal for this sprint is to carry out and complete the different CRUD operations whilst also designing a wireframe for the application homepage whilst also completing the uncompleted work from sprint 1.

##### Sprint Review

I came across a little issue with the database so I had to reshuffle some columns and data - this was overflow from Sprint 1. I started my CRUD operations and they're almost complete, its just I came across some issues that are going to be ironed out in Sprint 3. The wireframe for the application homepage had to be dropped as I ran out of time.

##### Sprint Retrospective

The major blocker for this sprint was the reshuffling of the database and the data in it. I think next time, it's better to create an ERD so the database can be visualised right from the beginning. It took a while to get my different CRUD operations working, but I eventually got started after asking for support from the team and going back through the lesson videos.

#### Sprint 3

##### Sprint Goals

The target for this sprint is to finish the CRUD operations, creating an initial GUI that can be built upon over the weekend and to start creating the unit tests.

##### Sprint Review

The CRUD operations were done and an initial GUI was created so the main objectives I set out for the day were completed. However, I didn't get round to starting my unit tests as the initial GUI took longer than expected. 

##### Sprint Retrospective

Although the main objectives of this sprint was met, it took much longer than it should have - I was hoping to achieve these objects much earlier in the day so I can start my unit testing. I think going forward, I should set a structure and time box each task as things turn out to become messy. It'll also help me set my goals for each sprint with far more accuracy as I would be able to better estimate how long certain tasks should take.

#### Sprint 4

##### Sprint Goals

To start my unit testing and add more functionality to my GUI, such as the create and delete functions.

##### Sprint Review

The extra functionalities I set at the beginning of this sprint was met and caused no major issues however, the unit tests have caused me big problems. An update error for every test is generated but there's no issues with the code itself. I've spoke to my fellow group members and some have experienced the same problem but yet to solve it.

##### Sprint Retrospective

A very frustrating and infuriating sprint as I can't find a solution for the unit test 'update' problem. I think working with the guys tomorrow should help and I'll ask for their advice.

#### Sprint 5

##### Sprint Goals

The goals for sprint 5 is to fix the update error for my unit tests, add a second players page and have that page linked to the first page

##### Sprint Review

For the first time in this project, all the goals set out for a sprint was achieved! All the tests are functional and are passing, whilst the second page is all set up and linked with the first page.

##### Sprint Retrospective

This was the best sprint in the whole project! As mentioned in the review, all the goals set at the beginning of the sprint was achieved. I spent the last couple of hours of sprint 4 trying to get the tests working but had no success. So I thought it'd be best if I started sprint 5 by creating the second page and linking it to the first and thankfully, that went smoothly. Then in the afternoon, after looking at the tests and slightly amending them, they also passed to my delight! 

#### Sprint 6

##### Sprint Goals

The aim of this final sprint is to add a background image, check all the data is in place (each team has 5 players and each player has their attributes filled in), the project board is up to date and do a mock demonstration to the group.

##### Sprint Review

After encountering small problems with the background image, everything was sorted. The database had the relevant data in there and the project board is up to date.


##### Sprint Retrospective

This project has been a big learning curve. I've managed to produce my MVP in the end which I'm happy about but there's a few improvements that could be made:

- Creating a homepage

- A navigation window
- Utilising drop down menus
- A quiz

I look forward to developing this application in the future.
